1. Preparing breadcrumbs
If you have breadcrumbs then simply skip these steps and move on to the steps of preparing veggies below. For a more crispy texture, I recommend using panko bread crumbs.

1. Break 6 to 7 slices of bread and add in a mixer or dry grinder. You can use a few days old bread like white, brown, multi grain or whole wheat bread.
2. Preparing veggies
3. Now rinse and steam 3 medium to large potatoes, 1 medium to large carrot, 8 to 9 french beans and ⅓ to ½ cup green peas until they are completely cooked. You can cook or steam the vegetables in a stove-top pressure cooker, pan or instant pot. I have listed the cooking methods below.

Stove-top pressure cooker: Peel and chop potatoes, carrots and beans. Place them with the green peas in a pan or bowl. Add 2 cups water in a 3 litre cooker. Place a small trivet inside. Place the bowl with the veggies on the trivet. Pressure cook for 10 to 12 minutes on medium-heat. Let the pressure fall naturally in the cooker and then only remove the lid.
Instant pot method: Pour 1.5 cups water in the steel insert of 6 quart IP. Keep a trivet inside the steel insert. Place the whole potatoes, carrots, beans in a steamer pan or on the trivet. Take green peas in a small bowl and place it on the steamer pan or on the trivet. Pressure cook for 10 to 12 minutes until veggies are tender. Let the pressure release naturally.
Cooking in a pan: Peel and chop potatoes, carrots in small cubes. Chop the beans to small pieces. Place the chopped veggies and green peas in a pan. Add water just about covering the vegetables. Cover and simmer on medium-low flame until veggies are fork tender.
